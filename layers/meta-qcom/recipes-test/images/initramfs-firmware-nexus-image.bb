DESCRIPTION = "Tiny ramdisk image with all Nexus and Pixel devices firmware files"

# We do not use kernel image or kernel modules in the image, so remove the
# dependency on the kernel
KERNELDEPMODDEPEND = ""

# Firmware support for newer Nexus and Pixel devices depends on simg2img, which
# is provided by the meta-oe only. So they are split into the bbappend in
# dynamic-layers/openembedded-layer.
