# example:                                                                               #

# fix (network): After repeatedly creating and closing a socket a certain number of times, 
#  it is impossible to create a socket again.                                           #
#                                                                                      #
# 1. When the select interface is called and socket.close() is called in another thread, 
# the socket reference count does not decrement,                                         #
# Due to the upper limit of the total number of sockets (i.e., the reference count), 
# it is impossible to create another socket after creating a certain number of sockets. #
#                                                                                      #
# 2. When calling socket.close() to release resources, 
# the reference count is automatically decremented to promptly release the occupied resources and fix this issue#
#                                                                                      #
